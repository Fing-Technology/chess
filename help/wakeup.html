Use the 'Wake Up' button to send an e-mail to your opponent, letting them know that it is currently their turn.<br />
Only use this button if your opponent has not moved in some time and may have either not known or forgotten that it is their turn.<br /><br />
Use this button sparingly and responsibly. If you are reported using this button an inappropriate number of times, you may have your account deleted.
