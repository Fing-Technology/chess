<p>There are several different kinds of chess notation available in WebChess.
This page describes them and gives examples. Examples for all the notations can
be <a href="#table">compared in the table</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>
<br />
<p class="noindent">The following notations are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#coord">Coordinate</a></li>
<li><a href="#alg">Algebraic</a></li>
<li><a href="#longalg">Long Algebraic</a></li>
<li><del><a href="#desc">Descriptive</a></del></li>
<li><a href="#int">International</a></li>
<li><a href="#verbous">Verbose</a></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2><a name="coord"/>Coordinate</h2>
<hr />
<p>Coordinate notation gives the starting square and the ending square as well
as special notation for captures, en passant captures, castle moves, check, and
mate moves.</p>
<h2><a name="alg"/>Algebraic</h2>
<hr />
<p>Algebraic notation gives the piece being moved (if the piece is not a pawn)
and part of the starting square only when the starting square is ambiguous (i.e. more
than one piece could have moved to the ending square) as well as the ending square.
Special notation for captures, en passant captures, castle moves, check, and
mate moves is also given. This is the notation used in
<acronym title="Portable Game Notation">PGN</acronym> files.</p>
<h2><a name="longalg"/>Long Algebraic</h2>
<hr />
<p>Long Algebraic notation is the same as Algebraic except the starting square
is always given as a full square.  This notation is the same as the (incorrectly
named) PGN notation in previous versions of WebChess.</p>
<h2><a name="desc"/>Descriptive</h2>
<hr />
<p>Descriptive notation gives the piece moved and the ending square as a
descriptive location counted from the players own side.  For instance:
if a bishop moves from its home square to a square four spaces up in front of the
queen side rook, then the notation is like this: B-R4, which means the bishop
moved to the fourth square ABOVE the queens rook.  If the other bishop could
have moved into the fourth square above the king side rook, then the notation
removes the ambiguity by adding queen side information like this: B-QR4.  If the
starting square is ambiguous, more information is given in the notation just as
with ambiguous ending squares.  For captures, only the moved piece and the
captured piece are given as follows: NxR unless the move is ambiguous, then more
information is given.  Your opponents back rank is 8, your own back
rank is 1.  Special notation for captures, en passant captures, castle moves,
check, and mate moves is also given.  Because this notation is based on the
starting positions in an orthodox game, this notation may get a little confusing
in Chess960 games.</p>
<h2><a name="int"/>International</h2>
<hr />
<p>International notation gives the starting square and the ending square as a
four digit number in the format: starting file, starting rank, ending file,
ending rank.  All numbers are counted 1-8 from the left-hand, white-side dark
square (A1).  For instance, a move from the 3rd file, 4th rank, to the 5th file,
5th rank would be displayed as 3455.  No special notation is given for captures,
en passant captures, castle moves, check, or mate.  For castle moves, the
notation follows the king.  For a-side castles (long castle) it would be 5131.
Because of this, castle move notation may get confusing in Chess960 games
because the king may only move one square, and it becomes ambiguous if this move
was a castle move, or a normal move.  For pawn promotions the notation is a little
different.  When a pawn is promoted, the final number (the ending rank) is
replaced with a numerical representation of the piece the pawn was promoted to,
such as: 4742, which would be a pawn moving along file 4 from rank 7 to rank 8
(not shown because it is understood), and promoted to a rook (2). Q=1, R=2, B=3,
N=4.  If the move had been a pawn capture and promotion, the notation would be:
4751. Capturing the piece on file 5, and promoted to queen.</p>
<h2><a name="verbous"/>Verbose</h2>
<hr />
<p>Verbose notation is just like regular speech: "pawn from a2 to a4", "queen
from d5 captures g2, check".</p>

<table><a name="table"/>
	<caption><strong>Comparison Table</strong> The verbose notation is listed first
	to describe the moves for comparison with the other notations.  All moves are
	equivalent and taken from an orthodox game.  (Red entries denote disambiguous notation,
	notation for a move where there were at least two possible pieces that could have moved
	into that position legally.)</caption>
