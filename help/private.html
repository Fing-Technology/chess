Use the 'Private' checkbox to send chat notes to yourself.<br />
You may use this function for notes on moves, strategies, your opponent, etc.<br />
These notes will be shown in red and only be shown to you, not your opponent.<br />
If you intend to send a note to yourself, it is recommended that you select the checkbox before entering your message to avoid sending a 'chat' viewable by your opponent.<br />
There is also a small unavoidable bug where, if you do not check the private checkbox first, your message may be lost due to a page refresh when you do select the checkbox.
