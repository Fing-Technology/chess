<p>Chess960 (also called Chess 960, Fischer Random Chess, Fischerandom Chess, FR
Chess, Random Chess, or FullChess) is a chess variant created by Grandmaster
Bobby Fischer where the initial piece positions are randomized within certain
constraints leading to games where creativity and talent are far more beneficial
to winning than rote memorization of opening moves.</p>
<br />
<p class="noindent">The board is set up with the following constraints imposed
upon the initial position:
<ul>
<li>White pawns are placed on their orthodox squares.</li>
<li>All remaining white pieces are placed on the first rank.</li>
<li>The white king is placed somewhere between the two white rooks.</li>
<li>The white bishops are placed on opposite-color squares.</li>
<li>The black pieces are placed mirror-image to white.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Given these guidelines, there are 960 different possible layouts.  Hence the
name Chess960.</p>
<br />
<p>To play a Chess960 layout in WebChess, place a number between 0 and 959
inclusive in the Chess960 ID field of the invitation form.  This ID number
represents a specific layout and that layout is generated using an algorithm
based on the ID entered. (ID 518 represents the orthodox layout RNBQKBNR).  When
the invitation is sent, the layout is created.  To re-use that layout in a future
game, just note the Chess960 ID displayed during the game next to the Game ID as
such: Game #45 - 284; The number 284 is the Chess960 ID.  This ID is not
displayed during normal games.  Enter that number when inviting a player to get
that particular layout.</p>
